# Welcome!
ðŸ’¬ | My name's Oliwier, I am 18 y/o and I am a frontend developer using **Vue.js & Typescript** to make things happen. Most of my active projects are open-source and can be forked by anyone!

âš¡ | Interested? Go pick one of repos, test the source code & make your own improved version! I support the FOSS projects, because in my opinion every beginning developer should have something to pick when starting a programming adventure!

ðŸŒ± | I am currently learning Laravel (a backend PHP framework) to move to fullstack development in the late 2022 or early 2023!
